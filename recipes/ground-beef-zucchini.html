    <h1>Ground Beef with Zucchini</h1>
    <img src="../images/Ground-Beef-Zucchini.HEIC" width="300" alt="Ground beef and zucchini over rice topped with ketchup">
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This dish is very easy to make with a few simple ingredients and something that my mom would cook for me a lot. It might be surprising to see it topped with ketchup,
        but in my opinion, it gives it a nice tangy flavor from the vinegar and balances out everything.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Diced Onions</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>Neutral oil</li>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Sliced Zucchini</li>
        <li>Oyster Sauce</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In your pot, heat up oil, minced garlic, and your diced onion. Cook until the onions are soft and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add in your ground beef and season with anything you want. I just use salt and pepper for now.</li>
        <li>Break up the ground beef and let it cook for a bit. In the meantime, cut your zucchini.</li>
        <li>After the meat has cooked for a bit, add in your oyster sauce and stir to incorporate.</li>
        <li>Add in your zucchini slices.</li>
        <li>While the meat will release some water, add in enough water to cover the zucchini so it can get soft.</li>
        <li>Simmer until the zucchini is soft.</li>
        <li>Serve over hot rice and top with ketchup!</li>    
    </ol>
