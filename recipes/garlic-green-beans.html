    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your oil in a frying pan. You can use a chopstick or anything wooden to make sure the oil is hot enough.
            Dip it into the oil and if you see the oil bubbling, it is hot enough.</li>
        <li>Add you green beans, cut however you want and fry on each side for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Take out your green beans and dispose of most of the oil, until you have just enough to saute the garlic.</li>

        <li>Add your green beans back in and saute with the garlic for 1 more minute.</li>
