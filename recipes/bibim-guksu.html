    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite cuisines is Korean. Bibim-guksu, or Spicy mixed cold noodles, is one of my favorite dishes to make
        especially because of how hot it's been recently. They are super easy to make and use most of the essential Korean cooking
        ingredients you may have already if you make Korean food often. This is not a traditional recipe, as most times I just use what I have.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Choice of noodles: I use buckwheat noodles</li>
        <li>Choice of vegetables: I use cucumber, cabbage, carrots, etc.</li>
        <li>Sauce:
            <ul>
                <li>Gochujang</li>
                <li>Gochugaru</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Minced Garlic</li>
                <li>Vinegar</li>
                <li>Sesame Oil</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            </ul>  
        </li>
        <li>Egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>I start with chopping up my vegetables while I get my water boiling. Julienne your cucumbers, carrots, and chop up your cabbage.</li>
     <li>Next, I mix all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl.</li>
     <li>Now, is time to boil your noodles. I usually will test the noodles 5 minutes in and if it needs more keep testing every minute. </li> 
     <li>Once your noodles are done, don't strain out the water but just take the noodles out of the water. We will keep the water boiling and add in an egg. Boil for 6-7 minutes for the perfect soft boiled egg.</li>
     <li>After taking out the noodles, run them under cold water until they are no longer hot.</li>
     <li>Add the noodles to your sauce and mix, adding in your veggies and egg once ready!</li>  
    </ol>
